Milk bar _Dziarski_ is a place for people who sahre a hunger and a passion for tattoos. It is very cozy, like at your mom's place and no one comes out with an empty stomach -- but no one will be embarrassed by sitting in the corners. We are _dziarscy_ figuratively and literally. On the ground floor you can nurture your body and eyes, regain energy, and on the floor treat yourself with a new tattoo.

The symbol of _Dziarski_ is a combination of anchor and spoon -- the first one, because we want you to feel with us like home, like in your home port, and we want you to come back to us regularly. A spoon has neither teeth nor the blade, but guarantees safety and a full belly. Both items are arranged in a positive sign, because we are very positive about life and always strive to develop in the right direction.

Colour-wise we go with the calm, but incredibly fresh mint green (we prefer a light shade, but there are three others at out disposal) and coal-black black.

This whole concept is from the classes with Wojtek Janicki.
