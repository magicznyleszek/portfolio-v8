A graphic for hipsterish [_picture disc_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_disc) mad on the classes with Agata Kulczyk. The San Francisco based [Davka](http://davkamusic.com) is a jewish quartet composing a blend of traditional klezmer, sephardic and "classical" European music with contemporary jazz and pop. Four instruments, no vocals and the story straight from the Bible -- about a Judith playing spy-assassin with succesful beheading of Holofernes.
